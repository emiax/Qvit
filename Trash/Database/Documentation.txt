-- How to create a database that can be interpreted by my program. --

 - Database tables begin with a certain prefix, underscore + class name transformed to plural form.
 	ex:
 		color_Swatches
 		color_Themes
 		
 	There are two types of tables, "ObjectTables", and "RelationTables".
 		
 - ObjectTables have their corresponding class name inside curly braces in their 'comment'-field.
 	ex:
 		'Color swatches {Swatch} that do something very fancy and contain information about something nice' 
 	or simply:
 		'{Swatch}'
 		 		
 
 - To create one-to-one/one-to-many relaitons, one of the tables that should be connected to each other
   should be equipped with a comment on this form:
   	  { OtherClassName,
   		ThisRelationNameSingular,
   		ThisRelationNamePlural,
   		OtherRelationNameSingular
   		OtherRelationNamePlural }
   		
   		(ThisClassName is determined by the table comment)
   
   To create many-to-many relations, create an independent table without comments, and call it what you like.
   This table should have three columns: a primary key, and two ClassNames of the objects to be related.
   
   Each of the rows should have the following comments:
   	  { ClassName,
   		RelationNameSingular,
   		RelationNamePlural }
